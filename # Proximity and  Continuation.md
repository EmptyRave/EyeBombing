# Proximity and  Continuation

## What do they mean?
**Proximity:** Nearness in space, time, or relationship.

**Continuation:** The action of carrying something on over time or the state of being carried on.

### Things we can associate with Proximity
* A car Park
* A light source
* Any two or multiple objects close to each other
* And more

### Things we can associate with Continuation
* Train Tracks
* Roads
* Time
* Movement of the universe
* Life

## Our Own Images

### _Train Tracks_

This image was taken to show the continuation of the train track, later on in this presenation I will show you a longer train track. I was limited to how I could take the picture based on the fact I had a door between me and the tracks.

**Why is this continuation?**

As we mentioned earlier, continuation is something carrying on, and this is what the train tracks represent very well as there is no start nor finish and they continue outside of the picture frames.

### _Train Passing_

In this video, you can see the train passing quickly and each carriage that passes is exactly the same. Again this is continuation as it looks like the train never ends in the video.

### _Water Ripples_

I am sure that everyone knows this is outside the O2 Arena. The water ripples are within close proximity and is also a good example of continuation. The ripples is continuing to go on for a long period of time until the water has been turned off, otherwise the ripples will keep on repeating itself.

**The next images have been taken of objects within my home to represent what Continuation and Proximity can be.**

### _Floorboards_

This is an image of floorboards, i decided to use this due to the repitition of the wooden planks, I feel this conveys contiuation quite well. Aswell as being visually apealling.

### _Keys_

Here I have captured an image of piano keys. The keys are going off the image which is continuation and the keys are next to each other in a close proximity.

### _Bricks_

I used this image as i tried to capture continuation aswell as proximity, I attempted this by focusing in on the first brick alowing the rest of the bricks to becoming more obscured.

### _Heater_

![Tiles](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181601.jpg "Heaters")

This is an image of a wall heater i decided to use this picture as I feel the angel of the shot helps to display continuation, aswell as the contrast of the colours within the image blend well together.

### _Radiator_

![Tiles](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_20161008_181959.jpg "Radiator")

This is my favourite image of the series this is due to the deception the camera has created by being angeled over the radiator, I feel this gives the picture alot of depth and repition which ties in proximity and continuation. aswell as this the shadows created by surrouding lighting which is hitting the white radiator gives off a three-dimensional effect.
