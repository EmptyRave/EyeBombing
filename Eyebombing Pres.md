This is an advertisement which the O2 had up promoting their bowling isles. The good thing about this image is the face is clearly seen. The image as a whole is clean, the shadow in the bowling holes add the definition of depth, it doing so it creates a contrasting colour to the pink defining the face more.

The image is a little hard to see the face however rest assured, there is a face. In addition to the face, you have a leg and the body too. With the help of Photoshop, I was able to bring out where I see the face more.

I promise you I did not litter. The face is self explanitory, the image was taken outside of the University. The irregular colours and shapes represent the eyes. There are a few stones on the face which can be pimples. The tissue is the mouth. The image would be hard to replicate as the tissue will fly away.

![Wall](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/20161003_135738_(Custom).jpg "Wall")

The wall image may not look like a face at first however if we add goggles, would it look more like a face? You have the two eyes which can easily be seen. The "Brickfields" is representing the mouth in this image.

![Rubbish](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/20161003_140048_(Custom).jpg "Rubbish")

The image has a little more definition than the rest. The grass can be representing hair, however volatile it may be. There is two tissues to be the eyes and there is also the crisp packet representing the mouth.

![Floor](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/20161003_140232_(Custom).jpg "Floor")

There is the two panels which are joined much like a robotic cartoon style. The repaving adds contrast which can be the mouth.

![Bike](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/20161003_140544_(Custom).jpg "Bike")

The face is seen in this image. The cycle represent the eyes, the connection between the eyes can be the bridge of glasses, therefore it can be an accessory. The pavement texture canb be the mouth which has emotion of being frustrated.

![Water Well](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/20161003_141024_(Custom).jpg "Water Well")

This is one of the better images because of the positioning of the well key holes. The face looks as if it is taken to the side, not positioned looking staright at the camera, instead looking in the distance at an object in the distance.

![Train](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/20161003_160444_(Custom).jpg "Train")

This was taken on the train. The eyes are the two arrows which can be represented as happiness. The "Open" being the mouth.

![Plug](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_0002.jpg "Plug")

The photo of the plug looks like it could be a face which is supported or shocked with the eyes and mouth being wide open. All I did was rotate the photo to make it look like a face.

![Skirting](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/IMG_0001.jpg "Skirting")

This is two bolts on a door it is not the clearest to see a face but the line at the bottom is slightly thicker and bolder than its surrounding area hence the mouth feature.

![PS4](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_182657.jpg "PS4")

This is a playstation 4 controller which has a pretty distinctive face.

![Water Drops](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_184013.jpg "Water Drops")
This is some water in a wok enjoying itself in its element.

![Dial](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_184108.jpg "Dial")

This is a dial on a portable heater which looks like a pretty sad face.

![Wood](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_182859.jpg "Wood")

This image was not set up and was found in its caputred condition, it shows a face that almost looks real as the eye has some detailing adds a nice touch to the image.

![Beemer](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_183013.jpg "Beemer")

Set of keys which were found next to these two japanese bottle caps, it looks like a shocked face in my opinion.

![Fruit](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_183737.jpg "Fruit")

These pieces of fruit convey a very happy face found in a fruit pot exactly how it it positioned.

![Tomato](https://github.com/EmptyRave/EyeBombing/blob/master/Jacob%20Images/IMG_20161023_183900.jpg "Tomato")

Tomato and mozarella another silly face.
